Analyzing Crochet Products into Patterns Using Artificial Intelligence


1.  (Business Understanding):

Project Objective: Convert crochet product images to patterns using AI.

Main functions:
Upload images.
Analyze the image to extract stitch and design details.
Generate patterns via ChatGPT.
Display pattern instructions to the user.

Technical Requirements:
User Interface: Web or Mobile App (choose as needed).
Backend System: Image Analysis using AI Models, ChatGPT Integration to Generate Patterns.
API Integration: Connect the system to ChatGPT API and Image Analysis Interface.



2. Data Understanding
Objective: To collect and analyze available data to extract insights and information.
Data required:
Images of crochet products.
Data about stitch types, colors, dimensions (which will be extracted from images using image recognition techniques).
Sources:
Images will be uploaded by the user.
Data will be extracted using a computer vision model such as CNN to detect colors, stitches, and size.


3. Data Preparation:
Objective: Prepare data for training and analysis.
Steps:
Image upload: Allow the user to upload images using the Flask-built user interface.
Image analysis: Use image processing techniques to extract information about stitches, colors, and dimensions.
Data formatting: Convert the extracted data into a suitable text format, such as:
Stitch type
Colors
Number of stitches in rows

4. Modeling:
Objective: Create a model to analyze images and generate patterns.
Models used:
Image analysis using image recognition techniques (such as CNN): to extract details such as stitches and colors.
Using ChatGPT via API: Build an API to interact with ChatGPT and generate pattern instructions based on the input data.
Steps:
Train a model to analyze images.
Set up an API between the image recognition model and ChatGPT.


5. Evaluation
Objective: Evaluate the performance of the system based on the results of the analysis and generation.


Evaluation criteria:
Accuracy of image analysis (are the details extracted accurately?).
Accuracy of pattern instructions (are the instructions executable?).
User satisfaction with the results of the displayed pattern.
Steps:
Test the system using various images.
Ensure that the interpretation and generation are accurate and realistic.

6. Deployment

Objective: To evaluate the system performance based on the analysis and generation results.
Steps:
Deploy the application using Flask to provide an image upload interface.
Enable ChatGPT to generate pattern instructions based on the extracted data.
Deploy the application to appropriate servers to enable access from different devices.

Production setup:
Use WSGI such as Gunicorn or uWSGI to run the application in a production environment.
Ensure that all packages and the virtual environment are ready.
